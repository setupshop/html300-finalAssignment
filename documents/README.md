Proposal: Design a website for a mobile application I am trying to build. This application's main feature is processing online payments (accepting payment and depositing payment in to the user's account). The website will have the same feature and will be using one of the main payment APIs that are currently available. Example: PayPal, googlePay, Square etc...
Objective: The purpose of this website is to provide the application users with an alternative platform to use the our services.

About the Application: The app provides users with a platform to form groups and contribute and save a certain amount of money in a set period of time.

Description of Rotating Saving & Credit Association
A Rotating Savings and Credit Association or ROSCA is a group of individuals who agree to meet for a defined period of time in order to save and borrow together. They are mostly informal, indigenous savings and credit institutions, which are prevalent in both developing and developed economies around the world formed to help community members save money for specific purposes (either individual or community level).
